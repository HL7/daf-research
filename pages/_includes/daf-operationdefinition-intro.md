It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile.

In the context of DAF-core profiles, Supported on any data element SHALL be interpreted as follows: (NOTE: The definition of Supported is derived from HL7v2 concept "Required by may be empty - RE" described in [HL7v2 V28_CH02B_Conformance.doc]())

  1. Servers SHALL be capable of representing the data element in the Patient resource if the data is available in their system.
  1. Servers SHALL be capable of including the data element as part of the query results as specified by the DAF conformance resources.
  1. Clients SHALL be capable of processing resource instances containing the data elements.
  1. In situations where information on a particular data element is missing and the DAF Responder knows the precise reason for the absence of data. Servers SHALL send the reason for the missing information using values from the value set where they exist or using the [dataAbsentReason](http://hl7-fhir.github.io/extension-data-absent-reason.html) extension. 
  1. Clients SHALL be able to process resource instances containing data elements asserting missing information.
  1. NOTE: Servers or Clients who do not have the capability to store or return a data element listed as "Must Support" in the DAF-Core profiles can still claim conformance to the DAF profiles using the DAF conformance resources.
